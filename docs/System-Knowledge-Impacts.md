## Unclear or Contradictory Points

### 1. Employee Profile Enrichment Timing
**Question**: When does enrichment happen?
- Description says "Before sending raw data to Skills Engine, Directory processes through Gemini AI"
- But also says "For each employee listed in registration form: Create base profile... Query external APIs... Send to Skills Engine"
- **Clarification needed**: Does enrichment happen:
  - During CSV upload?
  - After CSV upload, before HR approval?
  - After HR approval?
  - On first employee login?

### 2. LinkedIn/GitHub OAuth Flow
**Question**: How does OAuth work?
- Description mentions "Query external APIs for enrichment: LinkedIn + GITHUB"
- But requirements.md says "First-Time Employee Login (ONE TIME ONLY) - Enrich Your Profile Page"
- **Clarification needed**: Does employee connect LinkedIn/GitHub:
  - During company registration (HR does it)?
  - On first employee login (employee does it)?
  - Both?

### 3. Decision Maker Designation
**Question**: How is Decision Maker designated?
- Description says "Single Decision Maker authorized to approve Learning Paths (optional if company uses auto-approval)"
- But doesn't specify:
  - Is it in CSV upload?
  - Is it set in Company Profile after registration?
  - Can it be changed later?
- **Clarification needed**: When and how is Decision Maker set?

### 4. Trainer Status Lifecycle
**Question**: Who controls trainer status?
- Description says "Content Studio updates trainer status to archived when uploading content for a course is completed"
- But also says "Active → Archived (after Content Studio update or HR disapproval)"
- **Clarification needed**: 
  - Can HR change trainer status directly?
  - Or only Content Studio?
  - What triggers "Invited → Active"?

### 5. Course Completion Display
**Question**: What exactly is displayed?
- Description says "Only courses in which the employee successfully passed the post-course exam are displayed"
- But also says "even if an employee fails a course, Assessment may identify new verified skills"
- **Clarification needed**: 
  - If employee fails course but gains verified skills, do we show the course as "failed" or not show it at all?
  - What about courses in-progress?

### 6. Skill Verification Button
**Question**: When does button appear/disappear?
- Description says "Verify Your Skills button is hidden" after verification
- But also says "When the employee completes new courses, Skills Engine automatically checks for new verified skills"
- **Clarification needed**: 
  - Does button reappear if new skills can be verified?
  - Or is it truly one-time only (initial verification)?

### 7. Learning Path Approval Policy Update
**Question**: How are policy updates handled?
- Description says "When a company registers or updates its Learning Path approval policy, Directory sends to Learner AI"
- **Clarification needed**: 
  - Can company change approval policy after registration?
  - If yes, where in UI?
  - What happens to existing learning paths when policy changes?

### 8. Redirect URLs ✅ ANSWERED
**Answer**: 
- URLs stored in config (see API Interaction Rules)
- All microservices use `/api/fill-content-metrics` endpoint
- User context passed in `payload` field of envelope structure
- Redirects likely use query parameters or tokens (to be confirmed in third description)

## Critical Implementation Notes

1. **One-Time Processes**:
   - Employee Profile Enrichment (LinkedIn/GitHub) - ONE TIME ONLY
   - Skill Verification ("Verify Your Skills" button) - ONE TIME ONLY

2. **One-Way Integrations** (Directory → Other, no response):
   - Learner AI (approval policy + Decision Maker)
   - Course Builder (language sync)

3. **Status Management**:
   - Trainer status managed by Content Studio (not Directory)
   - Directory only displays status

4. **Approval Workflows**:
   - Employee profile cards require HR approval after enrichment
   - Learning paths require Decision Maker approval (if manual)
   - Sensitive field changes require HR + Admin approval

5. **Data Flow Priority**:
   - Only passed courses are displayed as completed
   - Failed courses don't appear even if skills were verified
   - Skills Engine can update verified skills independently of course completion

---

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for clarifications** on unclear points above
2. **Receive API Interaction Rules** description (second description)
3. **Receive Integration with other microservices** description (third description)
4. **After all three descriptions received**: Create implementation plan
