# Enrichment Flow - Critical Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. ✅ OAuth callbacks redirect to enrichment page (already correct)
2. ⚠️ Need to ensure enrichment only happens when BOTH are connected
3. ⚠️ Profile state machine needs proper transitions
4. ⚠️ Company approval 404 error
5. ⚠️ Skills Engine integration missing after enrichment
