-- CLEAN DATABASE FOR TESTING
-- =====================================================
-- This script safely deletes all data from all tables
-- Use this before testing with a new company CSV
-- =====================================================
-- WARNING: This will delete ALL data from the database
-- NOTE: Admin accounts (directory_admins) are preserved
-- =====================================================

-- Disable foreign key checks temporarily (PostgreSQL doesn't support this, so we delete in order)
-- Delete in reverse order of dependencies to avoid foreign key violations
