-- Delete in reverse order of dependencies to avoid foreign key violations

-- 1. Delete employee requests (depends on employees and companies)
DELETE FROM employee_requests;

-- 2. Delete employee profile approvals (depends on employees and companies)
DELETE FROM employee_profile_approvals;

-- 3. Delete trainer settings (depends on employees)
DELETE FROM trainer_settings;

-- 4. Delete employee project summaries (depends on employees)
DELETE FROM employee_project_summaries;

-- 5. Delete employee managers (depends on employees)
DELETE FROM employee_managers;

-- 6. Delete employee teams (depends on employees and teams)
DELETE FROM employee_teams;

-- 7. Delete employee roles (depends on employees)
DELETE FROM employee_roles;

-- 8. Delete audit logs (depends on companies and employees)
DELETE FROM audit_logs;

-- 9. Delete employees (depends on companies)
DELETE FROM employees;

-- 10. Delete teams (depends on departments and companies)
DELETE FROM teams;

-- 11. Delete departments (depends on companies)
DELETE FROM departments;

-- 12. Delete company registration requests
DELETE FROM company_registration_requests;

-- 13. Delete companies (this will cascade delete any remaining dependencies)
DELETE FROM companies;

-- VERIFICATION: Check that all tables are empty
